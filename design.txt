# Terrarium Automation Config

## Methodology
* use the values section of the config to describe the current state/model of
  the terrarium and how changes in time or sensors readings update the model
* use the control section of the config to describe what actions need to be
  done when the model changes, triggering new events like turning off a light
  switch or watering a plant

---

## Values
* config.json specifies variables and indicators
* variable `values.x` is specified with `{"name":"x", "type":"variable"}`
* indicator `values.fn` is specified with `{"name":"fn", "type":"indicator"}`

### Variables
* modifiable, defined like `{"name":"varX", "type":"variable", "default":3.14}`
* can be referenced in any part of the controls section using `values.varX`
* changes to the variable state are logged in `log.txt`

### Indicators
* triggered by time or gpio: is a function that is called periodically and
  returns just a single value True/False when called
* setting the period in seconds for how often to check the indicator
* ex. `{"name":"light_clock", "type":"indicator", "period":60, "trigger": ...}`
* set the `ranges` inside the `trigger` for how measured values correspond to
  what the current state should be `"ranges": [{"a":-5, "b":5, "value":1}, ...]`

#### Time
* time trigger `"trigger": {"type":"time", "time_format":"HH:MM", ...}`

#### GPIO
* gpio trigger `"trigger": {"type":"gpio", "samples":5, "pin":14}`
* set the number of samples and sample_dt for how many measurements to do to
  compute the mean and std for logging and for actionable items

## Controls
* uses the conditions to perform actions only when the evaluation of the
  condition changes
* can be used to change variable state, turn pins on and off, run python code
* ex. `{"name":"water_plant1", "conditions":{"x==1":["st1","st2"], "x==2":...}}`

### Setup
* if pin(s) are set to input/output mode in the setup clause then those pin(s)
  will be accessible in the code using `controls.water_plant1.pins[0].on()`
* note the pin can be dynamic if a variable value is used to define the pin num
